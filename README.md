# Inference programming language specification

Inference is a domain-specific programming language designed by [Inferara](https://inferara.com) to enable Web3 developers to formulate properties of the native application algorithms in a familiar format similar to how unit tests are written.

Inference allows formal proof of the correctness of the specified properties to be received in an automated way.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Inference is a Web3 native applications-oriented, formal specification language.

This repository contains the specification of the Inference programming language. The specification is divided into several sections, each describing a specific aspect of the language. The language is designed to be simple and easy to learn, and its syntax is concise and similar to Rust.
