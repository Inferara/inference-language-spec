Inference design goals are as follows:

- Inference is intended to be a simple, concise, unambiguous, and easy-to-understand formal speficiation language.
- The language should have a taste of an imperative language and hide all the complexity of formal verification details.
- The language is intended for use in developing Web3 applications as a correctness specification language that ensures the application's properties and certifies the application's correctness.
- The language evolves in the directions of improving the power of automated deduction and beign applicaable to a wide range of blockchain arhitectures.
- Support for modern IDEs and code editors is very important.
