## Description

Definition

Enums, short for enumerations, are a user-defined data type in Inference that consists of a set of named integral constants. They provide a way to assign symbolic names to integral values, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

#TODO add low-level implementation details later on.

## Examples

```inference
enum Arch {
  WASM,
  EVM,
}

enum ContextType {
  Program,
  Contract,
}
```
