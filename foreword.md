# Foreword

Inference is a formal-specification programming language developed by [Inferara](https://inferara.com). The main goal of the language is to provide a simple toolkit for formally specifying Web3 DApps.

Current formal specification solutions require engineers to be proficient in functional languages, first-order logic, and sometimes formal methods (broadly speaking). In contrast, Inference is a very imperative-like language with a simple syntax and a set of rules that are easy to understand and follow.

> [!TIP]
> If you know Rust, you can begin using Inference in 20 minutes after reading this documentation.

In this repository, we assemble all required information about the language, its syntax, and its semantics. We also provide a set of examples and other useful information so you can start using Inference right away.
