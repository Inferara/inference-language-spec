# Foreword

Inference is a formal-specification programming language developed by [Inferara](https://inferara.com). The main goal of the language is to provide a simple toolkit to formally specify Web3 DApps.

Current formal specification solutions require engineers to be proficient in functional languages, first-order logic, and sometimes formal methods (broadly speaking). In contrast, Inference is a very imperative-like language with a simple syntax and a set of rules that are easy to understand and follow.

> [!TIP]
> If you know Rust, you can begin using Inference in 20 minutes after reading this documentation.

In this repository, we assemble all required information about the language, its [syntax](./lexical-structure.md), and its semantics. We also provide a set of [examples](./examples.md) and other useful information so you can start using Inference right away.
